# Random Quote Machine
This project allows you to search random quote machine by inputting text and showing you the results of the search. It is one of the [FreeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine) Front End Libraries Projects

### Here is a list of the user stories that this project must fulfill

1. I can see a wrapper element with a corresponding `id="quote-box"`.
2. Within `#quote-box`, I can see an element with a corresponding `id="text"`
3. Within `#quote-box`, I can see an element with a corresponding `id="author"`
4. Within `#quote-box`, I can see a clickable element with a corresponding `id="new-quote"`
5. Within `#quote-box`, I can see a clickable element with a corresponding `id="tweet-quote"`
6. On first load, my quote machine displays a random quote in the element with `id="text"`
7. On first load, my quote machine displays the random quote's author in the element with `id="author"`
8. When the `#new-quote` button is clicked, my quote machine should fetch a new quote and display it in the `#text` element.
9. My quote machine should fetch the new quote's author when the `#new-quote` button is clicked and display it in the #author element
10. I can tweet the current quote by clicking on the `#tweet-quote` a element. This a element should include the "twitter.com/intent/tweet" path in it's href attribute to tweet the current quote.
11. The #quote-box wrapper element should be horizontally centered. Please run tests with browser's zoom level at 100% and page maximized.
